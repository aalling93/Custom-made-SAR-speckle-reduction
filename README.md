# MATLAB-Speckle-reduction
Speckle is the inherent noise-like phenomenon present in Synthetic Aperature Radar images. Here, severeal different speckle filters are implemented to reduce the noise for different types of applications.

## Types in filters

Spekle reduction of SAR images in matlab using different filters: 

-Mean filter.  

-Frost filter. 

-Modified frost filter(added thresholds). 

-Lee filter(Using Masks, ENL ect). 

Note these fitlers are developed without the use of loops in Matlab.

## Report with code

For motivation or information of the filters, see:  https://dtudk-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/s154443_win_dtu_dk/EXSmZdvdXBNLjqZA4LytVYMByutyjZyiR4d0H7LDFp8rEw
